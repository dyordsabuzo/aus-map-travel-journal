Australia was always on my bucket list, and this year I finally made it! I started my journey in Sydney, exploring the Opera House and Bondi Beach.

## Highlights

- Walking across the Sydney Harbour Bridge
- Enjoying fresh seafood at the Fish Market
- Meeting friendly locals

Stay tuned for more adventures as I travel up the coast!
